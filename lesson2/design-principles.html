            <h1>Contrast</h1>
            <h2>Saver</h2>
            <a href="https://www.saver.is/">saver.com</a>
            <img class="contrast" src= images/PARC-Contrast.png alt="contrast"/>
            <p>This page fits very well with several concepts of the class,
                but I chose it in this step to represent the "PARC: Contrast". 
                In the hero image, which has a black background, the main object is a bird,
                but in contrast there is the name of the company and the button
                to display the menu. Everything seems one, and it is a pleasant
                and delicate contrast, but very well achieved.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="repetition">
            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <h2>Apple</h2>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">apple.com</a>
            <img class="repetition" src= images/PARC-Repetition.png alt="repetition"/>
            <p>In this example it is not possible to appreciate it in its entirety,
                but part of the presentation of this page is closely related to the
                repetition of objects, in this case smartphones, the same pattern
                is repeated throughout the page, although it can also be seen in
                good use of contrast.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="hierarchy">
            <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
            <h2>Root Studio</h2>
            <a href="https://rootstudio.co.uk/">rootstudio.com</a>
            <img class="hierarchy" src= images/Visual-Hierarchy.png alt="visual Hierarchy"/>
            <p>This page for me is a work of art, here the visual hierarchy can be seen very
                clearly, a strident yellow, large letters and above all that a moving
                giraffe (see in the link), surely the colors were chosen based on the animal.
                there is nothing left to chance.</p>
